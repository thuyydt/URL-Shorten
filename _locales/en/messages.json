    "message": "v.gd and is.gd are sister services, but are two separate URL Shorten. They're run by the same team and on the same platform, so their functionality is very similar. The main difference between them is that v.gd displays a link preview page by default whenever somebody visits one of its shortened URLs, but is.gd doesn't (by default it sends people straight to the link's destination). For this reason v.gd can be seen as a slightly \"safer\" option and is handy for users who always want to know where a link goes before clicking it.",
